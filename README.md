# Pricing Analysis – Online Retail

This repository contains a personal data science project using a public online retail dataset as a proxy for a large-scale retail environment such as RD Saúde.

The goal of the project is to practice core data science skills, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and building a baseline machine learning model.

## What was done
- Data loading and cleaning (cancelled invoices and returns removed)
- Revenue and top-product analysis
- Feature engineering from timestamps
- Baseline Linear Regression model for pricing
- Model evaluation and interpretation

## Dataset
Public **Online Retail II** dataset from Kaggle.

## Notes
This project is a learning exercise and will be iteratively expanded with more advanced modeling and features over time.
